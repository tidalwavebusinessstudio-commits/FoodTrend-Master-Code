## AI Design Instructions

When generating or modifying designs:

1. **Check this document first**
2. Maintain wavy/flowing transitions
3. Include device mockups with real content
4. Use locked color palette only
5. Prioritize conversion psychology over aesthetics

> **If design choice conflicts with conversion psychology → Choose psychology**
