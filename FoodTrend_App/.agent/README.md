# Prime Directive - README

This directory contains the **foundational meta-rules** that govern all development, agents, skills, and guides in the FoodTrend project.

## 📜 The Hierarchy

```
1. PRIME_DIRECTIVE.md     ← HIGHEST AUTHORITY (this supersedes everything)
2. troubleshooting.md     ← All solutions documented here
3. workflows/             ← Automated processes
4. errors/                ← All errors logged here
5. scripts/               ← Automation tools
6. iterations/            ← Fibonacci-based version history
```

## 🎯 The Four Pillars

As mandated by **PRIME_DIRECTIVE.md**:

1. **Universal Error Logging** - Every error is captured
2. **Universal Fix Automation** - Every fix is automated
3. **Crash Data Collection** - All failures are learned from
4. **Fibonacci-Based Improvement** - Natural progression toward perfection


## 🚀 Quick Start (3rd Grade Edition)

**New to this?** Start here (in order):
1. **[HOW_TO_USE.md](HOW_TO_USE.md)** - Complete beginner's guide with checklists and printable cheat sheet
2. **[DAILY_RITUAL.md](DAILY_RITUAL.md)** - 2-minute daily routine (makes this automatic)
3. **[workflows/start-new-project.md](workflows/start-new-project.md)** - Copy this system to any new project

**For AI collaboration:**
- **[GEMINI_REFINEMENT_PROMPT.md](GEMINI_REFINEMENT_PROMPT.md)** - Full comprehensive tasks
- **[GEMINI_DAILY_DRIVER.md](GEMINI_DAILY_DRIVER.md)** - Quick fixes

## 🔧 Advanced Quick Start

**When encountering any issue:**

```bash
# Step 1: Check if it's already solved
Read .agent/troubleshooting.md Quick Reference table

# Step 2: If not, use the debug workflow
Follow .agent/workflows/debug-issue.md

# Step 3: Solution found? Document it IMMEDIATELY
Add to .agent/troubleshooting.md
Update workflows as needed
```

**When creating any new system:**

```bash
# Follow Fibonacci iterations
v1 (Fib=1): Make it work
v2 (Fib=2): Document it  
v3 (Fib=3): Automate it
v5 (Fib=5): Make it self-healing
v8 (Fib=8): Optimize it
v13 (Fib=13): Near perfection
```

## 🔄 The Self-Improvement Loop

```
Error/Issue → Log → Document → Automate → Test → Optimize → Perfection
     ↓         ↓        ↓         ↓         ↓       ↓          ↓
   (n=0)    (n=1)    (n=1)     (n=2)     (n=3)   (n=5)      (n=∞→φ)
```

Every cycle makes the system smarter, faster, and more resilient.

## ⚡ Emergency Reference

**If the agent crashes:**
- Crash data auto-saved to `.agent/errors/agent-crash/`
- Check latest crash report for root cause
- Follow recovery steps in report

**If you encounter a new error:**
1. Log it to appropriate `.agent/errors/[category]/`
2. Fix it
3. Add to `.agent/troubleshooting.md`
4. Create workflow automation if repeatable

**If Prime Directive conflicts with other rules:**
- Prime Directive ALWAYS wins
- Update conflicting rule
- Document the resolution

## 📊 Success Metrics

Your system is healthy when:
- ✅ Errors don't repeat (automated fixes)
- ✅ Debugging is instant (documented solutions)
- ✅ Crashes are rare (self-healing)
- ✅ Quality approaches Fib(13)

## 🌟 Philosophy

> "Every error is a gift. Every fix is a lesson.  
> Every automation is a step toward perfection.  
> Every iteration follows the golden ratio."
