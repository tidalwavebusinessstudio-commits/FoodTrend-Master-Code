# ⛔ GROUND TRUTH GATE — MUST READ FIRST

Before making ANY statement about:
- deployment
- infrastructure
- backend status
- redeployments
- cron jobs
- hosting

You MUST:

1. Read `automation_persistence_protocol.md`
2. Echo the following values verbatim:

   - **Backend URL**: `https://api.yourfoodtrend.com`
   - **Railway Project**: `respectful-solace`
   - **Deployment Status**: ✅ ONLINE
   - **Health Endpoint**: `https://api.yourfoodtrend.com/health`

3. If you cannot verify these, STOP and ask the user.

---

## ❌ You are NOT allowed to:

- assume
- suggest redeployment
- propose setup steps
- narrate memory updates

**until step (2) is complete.**

---

## ⚠️ This is a PROCEDURAL LOCK, not a reference document.

Any response that discusses infrastructure without first echoing the values above is **INVALID** and must be rejected by the user.
