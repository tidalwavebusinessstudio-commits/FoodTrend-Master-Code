**Source:** Alex Hormozi's "$100M Leads" integrated with FoodTrend's business model  
**Purpose:** Map proven lead generation principles to restaurant + influencer marketplace

---

## 🎯 THE CORE FOUR (Applied to FoodTrend)

Hormozi's fundamental truth: **There are only 4 ways to let anyone know about anything.**

### 1. Warm Outreach (1-to-1, Warm Audience)
**For Restaurants:**
- Personal calls/texts to restaurant owner contacts
- Direct messages to food industry connections
- Email campaigns to gym launch alumni (they own restaurants too!)

**For Influencers:**  
- DM food creators you follow
- Text local food bloggers
- Email your existing creator database

### 2. Post Free Content (1-to-Many, Warm Audience)
**For Restaurants:**
- Case studies: "How we added 213 members to a San Diego gym" → "How we filled 42 weekend tables for an Austin taco spot"
- Before/after stats (your 42% traffic increase)
- Client testimonials

**For Influencers:**
- "Turn your food posts into $2,500/month residual income" content
- Commission calculator demos
- Success stories of creators making money

### 3. Cold Outreach (1-to-1, Cold Audience)
**For Restaurants:**
- Call every restaurant in target cities
- Instagram DMs to restaurants with <1000 followers (need help most)
- Email scraping from Yelp/Google Maps

**For Influencers:**
- DM food creators with 5K-50K followers
- Comment on their posts, then DM value
- LinkedIn messages to "food content creator" profiles

### 4. Paid Ads (1-to-Many, Cold Audience)
**For Restaurants:**
- Facebook/Instagram ads targeting "restaurant owner" interest
- Google Ads for "restaurant marketing services"
- LinkedIn ads to hospitality decision-makers

**For Influencers:**
- TikTok/Instagram ads: "Get paid to eat" hook
- YouTube pre-roll: influencer income calculator
- Snapchat ads (younger creator demo)

## 💎 THE VALUE EQUATION (Your Offers)

Hormozi's formula for irresistible offers:

```
VALUE = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood of Achievement) / (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)
```

### Restaurant Offer (Current: $799-$2,499/mo)

**Dream Outcome:** "Fill your tables with zero ad spend"  
**Perceived Likelihood:** 
- "500+ restaurants trending monthly" (social proof)
- "42% average weekend traffic increase" (data)
- Case studies with real results

**Time Delay:** "First creator visits within 7 days"  
**Effort & Sacrifice:** "You provide meals ($12 cost), we handle everything else"

**Current Offer Strength:** 8/10 ✅  
**Improvement:** Add guarantee → "Fill 20 weekend tables in 30 days or we work free until you do"

### Influencer Offer (Current: $250/mo for 6 months, then $100/mo)

**Dream Outcome:** "$2,500/month passive income from doing what you already do"  
**Perceived Likelihood:**
- Real creator testimonials earning $X/month
- Commission calculator (interactive proof)
- Leaderboard showing top earners

**Time Delay:** "$250 your first month after first restaurant signup"  
**Effort & Sacrifice:** "Just share your unique link when you post about restaurants"

**Current Offer Strength:** 9/10 ✅  
**Improvement:** Add "First restaurant free $250 bonus even if they cancel"

---

## 📊 LEAD MAGNETS (Hormozi's Framework)

**Rule:** Lead magnet solves narrow problem, reveals bigger problem solved by core offer

### For Restaurants

**Bad Lead Magnet:**  
"Free consultation" ← Everyone offers this, no value

**Good Lead Magnet (Hormozi-Style):**
1. **Free Audit:** "We'll analyze your Instagram and tell you why you're not getting foot traffic"
2. **Case Study:** "How [Local Restaurant] added $12K in weekend revenue in 30 days"
3. **Free Trial:** "We'll send 5 creators to your restaurant this week for free"

**Best (What Hormozi Would Do):**
"We'll run your first 10 creator visits completely free. You only pay if you want to continue after seeing results."

### For Influencers

**Bad Lead Magnet:**
"Learn how to make money as a food influencer" ← Vague

**Good Lead Magnet (Hormozi-Style):**
1. **Calculator:** "See exactly how much you'd earn with your current follower count"
2. **Free Training:** "The 5-minute script I use to sign up restaurants (that got me to $3K/month)"
3. **Template Pack:** "DM templates, email scripts, and pitch deck for free"

**Best (What Hormozi Would Do):**
"I'll personally help you sign up your first restaurant and you keep 100% of the commission. After that, use your link and keep earning."

## 🔥 THE "GIVE UNTIL THEY ASK" STRATEGY

**Hormozi's Key Insight:** Don't ask for money until people are literally asking to pay you.

**Give:Ask Ratio:**
- Mature platforms: 3.5:1 (TV commercials)
- Growing platforms: 20:1 or more

**Applied to FoodTrend:**

### Content Strategy
```
Week 1: Post 10 value pieces (case studies, tips, results)
Week 2: Post 10 value pieces
Week 3: Post 10 value pieces  
Week 4: Post 10 value pieces
Week 5: ONE ask ("DM me if you want this for your restaurant")
```

**Result:** When you finally ask, people jump because they've been waiting for the opportunity.

## 📝 COPYWRITING PRINCIPLES (Hormozi's Headlines)

**Headline Components (Use 2+):**
1. **Recency:** "This week we..." "Just launched..."
2. **Relevancy:** "For Austin restaurant owners..." "If you're a food creator with 10K+ followers..."
3. **Celebrity:** "Gordon Ramsay's secret..." "How MrBeast's team..."
4. **Proximity:** "3 restaurants in [Your City] just..."
5. **Conflict:** "The restaurant marketing lie everyone believes"
6. **Unusual:** "The backwards strategy that tripled table bookings"
7. **Ongoing:** "Day 47 of filling restaurants with zero ad spend"

**FoodTrend Application:**

❌ **Bad:** "Get more customers"  
✅ **Good:** "How 3 Dallas restaurants added 100+ weekend tables this month (case study)"

❌ **Bad:** "Make money as influencer"  
✅ **Good:** "This 24-year-old food creator just made $4,800 last month eating free meals"

## 🎬 CONTENT CREATION (Hook, Retain, Reward)

**Every piece of content needs:**

### 1. HOOK (Get Attention)
- Question: "What if I told you restaurants would PAY you to eat?"
- Shock: "$2,500/month from Instagram food posts (here's how)"
- Curiosity: "I discovered the restaurant marketing secret big chains don't want you to know"

### 2. RETAIN (Keep Attention)
Use:
- **Lists:** "7 ways to double weekend traffic"
- **Steps:** "The 3-step creator visit that got me $1,200"
- **Stories:** "I was about to close my restaurant, then this happened..."

### 3. REWARD (Satisfy)
- Give actual value
- Answer the hook's promise
- Leave them wanting more

**FoodTrend Example:**

**Hook:** "This taco spot had ZERO customers on Tuesday nights. Watch what happened in 30 days."  
**Retain:** "Step 1: We sent 5 TikTok creators. Step 2: They posted X. Step 3: Tuesday became..."  
**Reward:** "Now they have a waitlist. Here's the exact system we used (link in bio)"

## 💰 PRICING PSYCHOLOGY (Hormozi's Models)

### The Anchor + Decoy Strategy

**Current FoodTrend Tiers:** ✅ Already doing this right!
- Momentum: $799/mo (Decoy - seems too little)
- **Velocity: $1,299/mo** ← ANCHOR makes this look like a steal
- Dominance: $2,499/mo (Anchor - makes Velocity look cheap)

**Why This Works:**
People don't know if $1,299 is expensive. But compared to $2,499, it feels like a deal!

### Scarcity + Urgency

**Scarcity (Limited Amount):**
"We only onboard 5 new restaurants per month per city to ensure quality"

**Urgency (Limited Time):**
"February slots close in 72 hours. After that, March waitlist only."

**Combined Power:**
"We have 2 of 5 February slots left for Austin. After Friday, you're on the March waitlist with 14 other restaurants."

## 📞 SCRIPT TEMPLATES (Hormozi-Approved)

### Restaurant Cold Call Script

```
"Hey [Name], this is Alex with FoodTrend.

Real quick - I noticed you guys just opened [Location]. 
Congrats on that, place looks incredible.

Quick question: Do you currently have a waitlist 
for weekend dinner service?

[If no:]
Makes sense. Most spots your size don't yet.

We specialize in filling tables for restaurants 
without ad spend. We work with [Local Competitor] 
about 3 miles from you.

We got them from 40% weekend occupancy to a waitlist 
in about 6 weeks using food creators.

Would it be worth 15 minutes to show you exactly 
how we did it?

[If yes:]
Perfect. Thursday at 3pm or Friday at 10am?
```

### Influencer DM Script

```
Hey [Name]! 

Saw your [specific post] about [restaurant]. 
That shot of the [dish] was insane.

Quick question: Do you currently get paid by 
restaurants for posts like that?

[If no:]
Cool, so you're basically doing this for love of food.
Respect.

We work with 500+ restaurants who pay creators 
like you to visit and post. Most make $250-500/month 
just eating free meals.

Want me to send you the quick breakdown?

[If yes:]
Nice! Are you getting residual income from it or 
just one-time payments?

[Most say one-time]

Ah, yeah most platforms do that. We do residual - 
you make $250/mo for 6 months per restaurant you 
sign up, then $100/mo for life.

Want to see how it works?
```

### Email Template (Restaurant)

```
Subject: [Restaurant Name] weekend traffic

Hi [Name],

I help restaurants like [Restaurant Name] fill 
their empty tables without ad spend.

Last month, we helped [Local Competitor] add 
42% more weekend traffic using food creators 
on TikTok and Instagram.

The best part? They only paid in food cost 
(~$300/month) instead of the $3K/month they 
were spending on Facebook ads.

If I could show you exactly how we did it, 
would Thursday at 2pm work for a 15-min call?

If not, just hit reply with a better time.
