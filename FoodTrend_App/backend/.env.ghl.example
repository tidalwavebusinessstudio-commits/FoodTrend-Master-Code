# Workflow Tags Configuration
# ===========================================
# These tags trigger workflows automatically when added to contacts.
# The workflows in GHL must be configured with "Contact Tag" triggers.
#
# Tag mappings:
#   restaurant-new     -> Restaurant Onboarding workflow
#   influencer-new     -> Influencer Onboarding workflow  
#   content-pending    -> 48-Hour Content Reminder workflow
#   content-urgent     -> 6-Hour Urgent Reminder workflow
#   content-delivered  -> Review Request workflow
#
# No additional configuration needed - tags are hardcoded in ghl-workflow-triggers.js
